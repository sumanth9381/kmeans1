## project title : Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall market called as Phonix Mall to findout how many customers are visited to a particular shop.on the basis of this prediction of annual income versus spending score
## DISCLIMER : In this particular dataset we assume anual income as a centriod and spending score from the range 1-100 called as data node as a cluster

## PROBLEM STATMENT
The american finance market as per the GDP of 2011 'conics_trillums' mall as in the range of out of 5. the owner of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different kind of clusters in entire mall

As a data science engineer predict the futurist financial market for upcoming GDP based on numbers clusters

the client want atleast top 5 clusters(shops).

## conclusion
According to the model basic prediction using machine learning algorithm kmeans clustering we found that cluster red color is a heighest cluster which attach more then 50 data nodes.

## REFERENCES
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values . the yellow spots represents centroids which is max only 3
